Software Development
    What are you looking to achieve with this order? (optional)
    Build software    Your questions    Will you share the application requirements and scope so that I can integrate all the needed features in the app?
    I need features for a mobile app that transfers a photo of a human body to a 3D model.
    I want to create an avatar of a human body and be able to change it depending on some parameters.
    I don't want that avatar will be adjusted "formally" as I got from another developer (see attachment). I need a real body with muscles like in the video attached.
    HI here is the link to the app interface.

    It shouldn't be exactly the same. Only functionality. The design you can make yourself.
    The first screen is just a picture to explain to the user what to expect.
    On the second screen, the user puts his/her data and goes to the next screen where there is a choice, to take a picture and create an avatar, or to enter additional parameter(s) and create a generic avatar. I thought the best way the body can be described with only one parameter is a body type.
    On the last screen, we get a current (fatty) avatar and the second avatar with the state say -20 pounds. The user can change 2 parameters for now and get different appearances of the future(muscle) avatar.
    An important thing that I already mentioned above. The avatar should be close to real mode, like either fatty without any muscle or with muscle, if for example, a 250 guy will lose 80 pounds he gains really muscles.
    
    Also, the fatty avatar can be not fatty. As I showed on the first screen.
    I think that to get a complete muscle avatar from a completely fatty avatar is a relatively complex technical thing, as well for a user is almost impossible to keep going for 1-2 years with diet and exercise. We can split the body into 3 states as I showed on the first screen. It will be easier to transform an avatar than.
    
    The delivery I expect is a working app for Ios and Android, ready to download and be tested, as well GitHub project with all the code.
